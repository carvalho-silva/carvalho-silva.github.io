I'm Gabriela (Gabi) Carvalho-Silva, a Brazilian astrophysicist.  I've got my BSc in Physics at the Universidade de Sao Paulo, and now I'm persuing my PhD at the same University. Currently, I'm also a visiting Postgraduate Research student at the University of Exeter.

My research focus on investigating how the properties of solar-like stars change with time -- stellar evolution!  Additionally, I investigate their influence on the search for worlds beyond our Solar System.
